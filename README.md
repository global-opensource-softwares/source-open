## What is Open Source Software?

Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product.

- Explanation that is easy to understand:

 Imagine your class is working on a science project. Everyone adds their research and ideas to a shared document. You can tweak what others have written and add your own insights.
 If another group sees your project and wants to use it, they can take it, make changes, and improve it too. This way, all the groups can build on each other’s work and make something even better!
Or just that guy in the class who just takes others work maybe add some jargon and present it as his own. That's @maz0n.

5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups: The license must not discriminate against any individuals or groups.
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor: Usage in any field, including commercial and research, must be unrestricted.
7. Distribution of License: The license terms must apply to all recipients without additional agreements.
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product: Rights should remain the same regardless of whether the software is part of a larger distribution.
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software: It cannot impose restrictions on other software distributed with it.
